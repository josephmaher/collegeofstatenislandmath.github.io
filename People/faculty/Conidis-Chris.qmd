## Biography

Prior to joining CSI Chris was a postdoc at Vanderbilt University
(Nashville, TN) and the University of Waterloo (Waterloo, ON,
Canada). He obtained his PhD in Mathematics at the University of
Chicago in 2009 under the advisement of Robert Soare, Denis
Hirschfeldt, and Antonio Montalban. His main areas of research are
Mathematical Logic and Computability Theory. In particular he is
interested in the interaction between Computability Theory and other
branches of mathematics and using logical techniques to extract new
information and theorems in other branches of mathematics.  Very
recently he has also acquired an interest in Algorithmic Statistics,
Data Mining, and applications.
