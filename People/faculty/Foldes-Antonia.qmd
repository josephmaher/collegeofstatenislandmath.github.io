## Biography

My favorite topics of interest are the properties of Brownian motion,
random walk and their local times.  In the last few years I was
working on the fine properties of iterated processes, logarithmic
averages, some integral functional of certain stochastic
processes. One of the main goal of my investigation was to develop a
general strong approximation method which allow us to study certain
processes through the investigation of the corresponding iterated
process. This led to the strong approximation of a wide class of
additive functionals.Another related topic of investigation was on
the measure of heavily visited points of the Brownian motion.

Recently I got interested in the fine properties of the maximal local
time and occupation time of the simple d-dimensional random
walks. Questions about maximal local time on subsets, maximal
occupation time of a finite set, multiplicity of the set of points
with a given local time, and joint asymptotic behavior of local and
occupation times of random walks in higher dimension are the object of
my most recent work.
