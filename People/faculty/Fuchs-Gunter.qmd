## Biography

Gunter Fuchs joined the CSI math faculty in Fall 2009. He received his
PhD in 2003 from Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany.  Before
coming to New York, he had appointments in Berlin and Muenster,
Germany.


His research focuses mainly on Mathematical Logic and, more
specifically, Set Theory. He has done work both in inner model
theory, forcing, large cardinals and applications of set theory in
algebra, and published his results in international journals.


Currently, he is interested in the structure of the generic
multiverse, consisting of the universe, its forcing extensions, their
ground models, their forcing extensions, and so on. He is also
exploring new types of inner models arising within the framework of
set theoretic geology. For more information, please consult Gunter
Fuchs's [personal
