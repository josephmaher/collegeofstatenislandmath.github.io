## Biography

Dr. Zeno Huang's research interests are in the fields of differential
geometry and geometric analysis. Some of his past work include
problems on Teichmuller theory and harmonic maps. More recently, he
works on projects on closed minimal surfaces in hyperbolic
three-manifolds and related problems. These problems lie on the
intersection of hyperbolic geometry, low dimensional topology and
geometric PDEs, and they often require combinations of techniques from
these fields to advance.

Dr. Zeno Huang earned his PhD from Rice University in 2003. Before joining CSI, he was a postdoc at the University of Oklahoma (2003-2004) and the University of Michigan (2004-2007).
