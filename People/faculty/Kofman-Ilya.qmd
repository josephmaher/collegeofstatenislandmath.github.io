## Biography

The focus of my research is knot theory and geometric topology.  Knot
theory is one of the most active research areas of mathematics
today. Much of this research is closely connected with mathematical
physics, and many results are of interest to biologists.  For such a
rich field of mathematical ideas, the "price of admission" is low for
great undergraduate research projects.


My current research is motivated by a deep open problem: how to bridge
the chasm between quantum and geometric topology.  Thurston
established the importance of geometric invariants, especially
hyperbolic volume, in low-dimensional topology.  A revolution in
knot theory was ushered in with the discovery of the Jones
polynomial in 1984, which led to vast families of quantum
invariants.  My aim is to establish the relationship between quantum
invariants of a knot, such as the Jones polynomial, and the geometry
of the knot complement.



Dr. Kofman is a member of a Focused Research Group (FRG) that received
an NSF-FRG grant for collaborative research on topics in geometric
topology. With this funding, Dr. Kofman has co-organized three major
international conferences, with a special focus on the Volume
Conjecture. Dr. Kofman earned his Ph.D. at the University of Maryland
at College Park in 2000, and came to CSI after four years as a postdoc
at Columbia University and Barnard College.  He earned an Sc.B. in
Mathematics at Brown University.  Dr. Kofman is a co-organizer of the
Geometric Topology seminar at the CUNY Graduate Center.  For details
