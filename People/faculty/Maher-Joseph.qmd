## Biography

Joseph Maher is interested in geometric topology, particularly in
the study of surfaces and three-dimensional spaces. Topics of interest
include knots, hyperbolic geometry, and the collection of all maps
from a surface to itself, which is known as the mapping class group of
the surface.  This group has interesting large scale geometry, and is
closely related to the space of all hyperbolic metrics on a surface,
known as *Teichmuller* space.

Joseph Maher received his Bachelor's degree from the University of
Cambridge, and his PhD in Mathematics from the University of
California, Santa Barbara. He has held visiting positions at the
University of Melbourne, the California Institute of Technology and
the Universite du Quebec Ã  Montreal, and taught most recently at
Oklahoma State University.
