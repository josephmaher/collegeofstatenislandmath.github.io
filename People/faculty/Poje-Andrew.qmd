## Biography

Dr. Poje has published a number of papers on Lagrangian mixing and
transport theory as applied to oceanographic flows.  His interests
include traditional and Lagrangian turbulence theory, low order
modeling, dynamical systems and numerical analysis.  His most recent
research activity concerns the application of geometric techniques to
quantifying non-conservative transport phenomena and designing
optimal Lagrangian observational strategies.
