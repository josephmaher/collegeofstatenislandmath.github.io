## Biography

Wladimir de Azevedo Pribitkin was born near the tropic of Capricorn
and grew up in the Sao Paulo-New York-Pennsylvania tri-state
area. Prior to arriving at CSI, he conducted postdoctoral research at
both Princeton University, where he held a three year postdoc funded
by the NSF, and at the Max Planck Institute in Germany. Dr. Pribitkin
has taught at small colleges such as Haverford, and at larger
universities, including Princeton. He enjoys teaching liberal arts
students as well as math majors. His main research interests are
number theory and automorphic forms. The former studies how the
natural numbers 1, 2, 3, ... are related, and the latter investigates
functions that obey an infinite set of symmetries. Both fields inform
each other, and employ tools from disparate areas such as abstract
algebra, analysis and geometry. Furthermore, they provide
applications to areas such as statistical mechanics, quantum chaos,
knot theory and cryptography. Dr. Pribitkin's subspecialty focuses
on the Fourier coefficients of automorphic integrals. These
coefficients often reveal remarkable properties of natural
numbers. Pribitkin would like to resolve the Riemann Hypothesis (not
for the money, of course!), but wouldn't mind answering
Lehmer's Question or settling the Linnik-Selberg Conjecture. If
you want to know more about this, send him an email or knock on his
door.
