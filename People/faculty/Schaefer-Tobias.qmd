## Biography

My mathematical research interests are nonlinear, nonlocal, and random
phenomena, described by ordinary or partial differential
equations. In order to solve them, I use exact, approximate, and
numerical methods. The practical applications of my research range
from nanotechnology, fiber optics, fuel cells, and biology to
finance. Recently, I got interested in the question how to quantify
the impact of microscopic noise on macroscopic observables. The study
of this problem involves the combination multi-scale techniques like
renormalization group methods or Lie-transform with stochastic
calculus. For more information, please visit my research
