## Biography

I am interested in numerical solution methods for [partial
differential equations
(PDEs)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equations)
which arise in problems in applied mathematics.  Recently I and my
co-authors have investigated a paradox, discovered by von Neumann in
the 1940s, that involves the reflection of weak [waves in a
gas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wavesshock).  Experiments show
that when a weak shock wave reflects off a thin wedge, a reflection
pattern consisting of three shock waves that meet at a "triple
point" apparently occurs.  Von Neumann showed, however, that such a
point is impossible - it cannot conserve mass, momentum, and
energy. Therefore, the apparent triple point must have an unknown
local structure of small but finite size.  To study this phenomenon,
problems for several systems of conservation laws, including the
[Euler equations
of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_equations#Euler.E2.80.94equations)
gasdynamics, were formulated.  Numerical solutions of these problems
have led to a determination of the local structure near the apparent
triple point, and theoretical analysis shows that this structure
provides a resolution of the paradox.  Recent experimental evidence
appears to confirm this resolution.



I received my PhD from the University of California, Davis in 2001.
Prior to coming to CSI, I was a visiting member of the Fields
Institute, Toronto, ON, and held visiting positions at the University
of Houston and Southern Methodist University.
