order: 0
---


The [Undergraduate Catalog](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/programs/MTH-BS) lists the requirements of the Math Major. The [Catalog](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/programs/MTH-MIN) also lists the requirements of the Math Minor.

Here we describe the requirements more informally.

## Pre-major requirements

Both the Math Major and Minor require a student to complete the pre-major requirements. These include the calculus sequence, a computer science or statistics course.

The major has some expectations on how a student fulfills their general education requirements. In particular there is an expectation of a one-year science course chosen from a select list.

## Major requirements

The Bachelor in Science of Mathematics and Mathematics 7-12 Bachelor of Science degrees are available. The latter requires an additional 24 credits in an Education Sequence and some required elective upper-level courses (below).


### Non-elective upper-level courses

To earn a Major in Mathematics there is an expectation of **nine** upper-level math courses beyond the pre-major. **Six** of these courses are required and described below. These courses are offered on a regular basis.

* [MTH 342](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/0661411) *Advanced Calculus II*

Continuation of MTH 341

* [MTH 347](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/0661421) *Number Theory*

Problems from many branches of mathematics often reduce to the
investigation of properties of a particular set of numbers; for
example, the set of integer solutions to a certain equation. This
course covers many elegant results from number theory, including some
applications to cryptography.

* [MTH 349](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/1176111) *Introduction to Cryptology*

Cryptography is the study of concealing information, and is often called encryption and decryption. Cryptology is the study of the principles, techniques, other uses, and history of cryptography. This includes cryptanalysis, the study of breaking encryption schemes and finding weaknesses in security. In this course, the student will learn several historical cryptosystems and the modern math one would use to break them. This course has substantive overlap with MTH 347 (Number Theory), MTH 339 (Abstract Algebra), and MTH 311 (Probability).

* [MTH 350](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/0661431) *Logic*

What is an algorithm? When is a function computable? When is a
question decidable?  Computability theory, a part of logic, shows that
some functions are not computable and some questions are not
decidable.

* [MTH 370](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/0661451) *Operations Research*

Many decision-making problems can be modeled as linear optimization
problems with constraints. Simplex method is used to find optimal
solutions for these problems. Transportation problem is discussed as
well.

* [MTH 372](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/1542081) *Practical Machine Learning*

Amazon's and Netflix' recommendations. Google's automatic translations. Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant and Cortana. All of these run on a common set of technologies: Machine Learning. Using a blend of software engineering and modern statistics, Machine Learning algorithms extract patterns from (possibly very large) data sets and generate likely functions that describe these patterns.

In this course, we will learn the basics of Machine Learning through hands-on implementation. By participating in competitions on Kaggle we will learn how to build a Machine Learning algorithm using the standard tools in the field as well as the theory that fuels the methods in the first place.

The course covers supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering and regression problems, and takes you through team work through 4 different competition tasks to build Machine Learning pipelines to take you all the way from raw data to predictions with prediction quality scoring.

* [MTH 410](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/0661471) *Mathematical Statistics I*

Statistics and Probability are closely coupled fields that deal with uncertainty and indeterministic processes in a way most mathematics does not engage with: Probability gives us a language and toolbox to model randomness and uncertainty, while Statistics gives us a toolbox to match probabilistic tools to concretely observed data as well as the ability to quantify our degree of certainty and perform quality control on our models.

In this course, we study statistics from a mathematical foundations perspective. Starting with the problem of how to estimate unknown quantities, and the ways that we can describe the quality of our estimators, the course continues to a formal theory of hypothesis testing and derives most tests that occur in a practical statistics course directly from properties of estimators and tests generated from them.

Many statistics courses will tell you *how* to test a claim using data. This course will tell you *why* these tests work.

* [MTH 411](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/departments/MATH-CSI/courses) *Mathematical Statistics II*

financial markets are covered. Students will develop financial models
and apply mathematical methods to concrete problems.

variable and take values in the complex plane.

* [MTH 435](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/0661531) *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos*

Why is the weather forecast accurate only once every few days? Is
tossing a coin really random? Techniques used to address these and
similar questions are introduced with concrete examples in physics,
biology and engineering.

* [MTH 437](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/0661541) *Mathematical Modeling*

the process of building useful models in a variety of real world
settings.

* [MTH 440](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/departments/MATH-CSI/courses) *Foundations of Mathematics*

truth and provability, shows that axioms can be true in different
ways, in different models. Fuzzy logic allows for bizarre intermediate

Rings, integral domains, fields. Introduction to Galois theory.

* [MTH 445](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/1300951) *Differential Geometry*


Differential geometry is a mathematical discipline that uses the
methods of differential and integral calculus to study problems in
geometry.

Using the analytical tools of calculus, Euler and Lagrange were able
to understand what are the curves on a surface that minimize the
distance between two points. A main question is how those curves can
be determined by using intrinsic measurement of the surfaces. In that
direction, Gauss in 1825 made some fundamental contributions to theory
of surfaces. His papers contain practical calculations of the
curvature of the earth based purely on measurements made on the
surface. He considered also properties of surfaces which are
determined only by the geodesic distances between points on the
surface independently of the particular way in which the surface is
located in the ambient Euclidean space. This led to his Theorema
Egregium, a fundamental result which explains why there cannot be an
accurate planar map of the world.

Differential Geometry allows also to explain and describe the
beautiful surfaces created by playing with soap bubbles. They are in
fact examples of "minimal surfaces", a family of geometrical object
that turns out to be quite relevant in applications. The above picture
is the famous “catenoid” already studied by Euler.

In the applied world, Differential Geometry allows to design shapes
used in everyday life, and is helpful when looking for a minimal path
on curved surfaces. In physics, it allows to describe complicated
physical systems leading to the Lagrangian formalism and General
Relativity. The success of these theories makes Differential Geometry
one of the fundamental tools in modern physics.

## Honors

To graduate with honors in Mathematics a student must have at least a 3.5 grade point average in Mathematics courses and must complete an honors thesis or project. The student must work closely with a Mathematics faculty member to define the project, carry out the research and investigation, and write the final report or prepare the final project. The student may receive credit through Independent Study for work on an honors project. The project must be accepted by the Honors Committee of the Department of Mathematics.
