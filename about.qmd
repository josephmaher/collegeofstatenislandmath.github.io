## In Teaching:

Provide quality instruction that gives a rigorous and comprehensive foundation for a diverse student body entering a wide variety of professions.

Create and maintain a strong undergraduate curriculum, providing a broad program of pure and applied mathematics, which includes courses serving each of the following student populations within the College:

* Mathematics majors and Computer Science/Mathematics majors, in preparation for careers using mathematics, as well as graduate study in mathematics and related fields;

* Students majoring in fields that use mathematics extensively, such as physical and life sciences, computer science, and engineering;

* Students planning careers with special mathematical needs, such as business and elementary education;

* Students in all fields fulfilling the College's General Education requirement in mathematics.

Create and maintain a strong graduate mathematics curriculum and program, both in the Masters degree programs at the college and in doctoral programs at the CUNY Graduate Center including support of CSI faculty initiatives at the CUNY Graduate Center in curriculum development, teaching of Ph.D. courses, mathematics dissertation supervision and the running of research seminars.
