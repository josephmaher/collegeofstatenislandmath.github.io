Welcome to CSI Mathematics. With approximately 25 full-time faculty members representing a number of the major fields of current research, the department offers courses for mathematics, engineering, and science students, as well as service courses for the general student body (see the full list of courses). We offer Bachelor of Science degrees with an emphasis on graduate school preparation, secondary school teaching, and a joint degree with computer science.

Many of our majors become involved in faculty-mentored undergraduate
research projects. Our full-time
[faculty](/People/faculty/) conduct research
in a variety of areas of pure and applied mathematics
[(MathSciNet)](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publications.html?arg3=&co4=AND&co5=AND&co6=AND&co7=AND&dr=all&pg4=IC&pg5=TI&pg6=PC&pg7=ALLF&pg8=ET&review_format=html&s4=College%20of%20Staten%20Island&s5=&s6=&s7=&s8=All&sort=Newest&vfpref=html&yearRangeFirst=&yearRangeSecond=&yrop=eq&r=1). Research
areas include applied mathematics, differential geometry, discrete
mathematics, geometric analysis, [hyperbolic conservation
laws](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/All-GC-Events/Calendar/Detail?id=25248),
knot theory, [logic](http://nylogic.github,io/), nonlinear analysis,
[number
theory](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Mathematics),
[probability](https://probability.commons.gc.cuny.edu/), and topology.

The College is conveniently located at the nexus of the vibrant New
York City area research community. Many faculty in the Department of
Mathematics contribute to, and organize, research activities at the
CUNY Graduate Center in Manhattan. Our faculty also supervise doctoral
students at the Graduate Center, and participate in research seminars
and colloquia with neighboring institutions.
